I have created a .NET Core console application to implement the carpark rate calculation engine. The console application takes two arguments, the first is the entry date and time and the second is the exit date and time. Any date/time format which can be parsed by .NET Core is accepted.

The Visual Studio solution in this repository contains the console application project and a nunit test project.
